## Issues

Issues are very valuable for any project.

Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Be specific.
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes; why you think this might be happening, tests that didn't work...

## Discussions

Discussions are essential:

- `General`: anything that is relevant to the project.
- `Ideas`: ideas to change/improve the project or propose new features.
- `Polls`: polls with multi options for the community to vote for and discuss.
- `Q&A`: questions for the community to answer, in a question/answer format.
- `Show and tell`: creations, experiments, or tests relevant to the project.
